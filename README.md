# Ruby on Rails Build Demo

This repository is for a little build system I am using for an assignment.

## Outline

This section plans out what to build.

Elements asked for the assignment are:

* Various checks of a codebase, which implies

    * I'd need a dependency checker or SBOM
    * Static analysis

* Shell/Groovy/Ruby/Python scripts
* Continuous integration tool
* Containers
* [RSpec](https://rspec.info)
